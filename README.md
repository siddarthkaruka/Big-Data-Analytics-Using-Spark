Welcome to Big Data Analytics using Spark!
We are delighted to welcome you to the fourth course in the MicroMasters in Data Science: Big Data Analytics using Spark.This course teaches you how to perform statistical analysis of very large datasets that do not fit on a single computer. You will learn some of the most popular tools for performing this type of analysis: apache spark, XGBoost and TensorFlow. You will learn how to use these tools through Jupyter Notebooks and experience the power of combining narrative, code and graphics to create convincing analytical documents.
